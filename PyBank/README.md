### Financial Analysis Script:

### Overview:
The Financial Analysis Script is a Python program that performs an analysis of financial data provided in a CSV file. It calculates various financial metrics and generates a summary report. This README provides instructions for using the script and understanding its functionality.

### Aspects:
1. Calculates the total number of months in the dataset.

2. Computes the total profits/losses over the entire period.

3. Calculates the average change in profits/losses between months.

4. Identifies the greatest increase in profits (including date and amount).

5. Identifies the greatest decrease in profits (including date and amount).

6. Outputs the results to both the terminal and a text file.



### Follow these steps to run the Financial Analysis Script:

### Prerequisites:
1. Python 3.x installed on your computer.

2. A CSV file named budget_data.csv located in the Resources directory. This CSV file should contain financial data with columns for dates and profits/losses.

3. Running the Script

4. Open a terminal or command prompt.

5. Navigate to the directory containing the script.

6. Run the script by executing the following command:

    python main.py

7. The script will process the financial data, perform the analysis, and display the results on the terminal.

Additionally, a text file named Financial_analysis.txt will be created in an analysis directory. This file will contain the same analysis results for your reference.

### File Structure
The project has the following file structure:

- main.py                     # The Python script for financial analysis.
- Resources/
  - budget_data.csv           # The input CSV file containing financial data.
- analysis/
  - Financial_analysis.txt    # The output text file with analysis results.
- README.md                   # This README file.
